# Prompt and Strategy Rules

## No Prompt Content in TypeScript

Do not hardcode durable prompt instructions in TypeScript. TypeScript should
load, validate, substitute, route, and assemble prompt assets. The content lives
in Markdown strategy/template files.

Runtime prompt assets:

- Scene strategies: `backend/strategies/*.strategy.md`
- Prompt templates: `backend/strategies/prompt-*.template.md`
- Architecture templates: `backend/strategies/arch-*.template.md`
- Selection templates: `backend/strategies/selection-*.template.md`
- Knowledge templates: `backend/strategies/knowledge-*.template.md`
- Comparison methodology: `backend/strategies/comparison-methodology.template.md`

Current strategy set is discovered from strategy frontmatter through
`strategyLoader.ts`; do not duplicate the scene list in TypeScript when the
frontmatter can be the source of truth.

Strategy frontmatter can also declare final-output requirements such as
`final_report_contract`. Add or update those fields in the strategy/template
layer, then update `strategyLoader.ts` and contract tests only when the schema
itself changes.

## Runtime Content Paths

SmartPerfetto uses two content tracks:

```text
Markdown strategies/templates
  -> strategyLoader.ts
  -> system prompt / quick prompt / classifier prompt
  -> agent runtime

YAML Skills
  -> invoke_skill MCP tool
  -> SkillExecutor
  -> SQL / trace_processor_shell
  -> DataEnvelope / DisplayResult
```

Strategies shape agent behavior. Skills collect deterministic evidence. Keep
that boundary intact.

The five native runtimes share external typed-intent and conclusion-declaration
templates. Scene choices come from the pinned strategy registry, and the finite
proof catalog comes from `SUPPORTED_DETERMINISTIC_CLAIM_RULES`. Valid JSON only
establishes a declaration's shape; it does not prove its interpretation or
claims correct.

Keep budget, question scope, deliverable and evidence access separate. An
`existing_only` turn cannot acquire new evidence; `read_new` never widens
authorization. Plans and source lookup are on demand. A larger budget does not
require a report, extra source pass, fixed Skill sequence or plan template.

Preserve the original claim semantics and references. Do not use wording,
headings or error-like prose to infer native completion, rewrite causal claims
into easier assertions, or force another answer. Structured delivery repairs
must respect the same strategy contract and remaining runtime budget.

The shared final semantic review uses an external template, the pinned provider
and original deadline, with no tools and at most one review. It checks the
canonical body, declarations and available evidence; it does not perform new
queries or rewrite the body. Known-misdiagnosis regex metadata is not a substitute
for this current semantic boundary.

Conversation's retained-evidence template receives only bounded, authorized
locator metadata from live captures. Titles and column names are data, not
instructions or proof; private metadata passes the existing projection before
entering the native prompt path. Missing or evicted data remains unavailable.

## Template Syntax

- Prompt/template variables use `{{variable}}`.
- Skill YAML parameter substitution uses `${param|default}`.
- Strategy frontmatter may include `keywords`, `compound_patterns`, `priority`,
  `phase_hints`, and final-report contract fields.
- Never write a variable in braces inside a template comment. Rendering
  substitutes inside comments too, and split points that search for a
  placeholder find the documented one first — that once injected the whole
  scene core inside an unterminated HTML comment and pushed the methodology
  preamble after it. Write `Variable "name" = ...` instead.
- HTML comments are stripped when a template becomes a prompt segment, so
  SPDX and authoring notes cost no tokens and never reach the model. Marker
  comments such as `<!-- tool-description:start -->` are consumed by their own
  loader before that point; keep any new marker on the same contract.
- The full-mode prompt is budget-bound (`MAX_PROMPT_TOKENS`). Before adding a
  section, measure with
  `npx jest src/agentv3/__tests__/claudeSystemPrompt.realStrategyTokenRegression.test.ts`
  and read the `[SystemPromptTokenGate]` line: a new section that pushes
  `droppedLabels` wider has traded trace-completeness or schema context for
  its own text.

`strategyLoader.ts` owns loading, frontmatter parsing, template rendering, cache
behavior, and phase hint access. Update it and its tests when adding template
syntax or frontmatter fields.

## Language Output

Runtime output language is controlled by `SMARTPERFETTO_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE`.

- Default: `zh-CN`.
- English override: `en`.
- Use `backend/strategies/prompt-language-zh.template.md` and
  `prompt-language-en.template.md`.
- For TypeScript-generated runtime text, use `localize(...)` from
  `backend/src/agentv3/outputLanguage.ts`.

Do not reintroduce hardcoded English-only or Chinese-only runtime messages in
paths that stream to users, reports, or insights.

## Validation

After changing strategies/templates:

```bash
cd backend
npm run validate:strategies
npm run test:scene-trace-regression
```

If the change affects startup, scrolling, Flutter, comparison, selection,
system prompt, verifier, or MCP tool behavior, also run the relevant Agent SSE
e2e command from `.claude/rules/testing.md`.

If the change affects final-answer completeness, evidence summaries, claim
verification wording, or OpenAI final-report continuation, include the focused
result-quality tests listed in `.claude/rules/testing.md`.
