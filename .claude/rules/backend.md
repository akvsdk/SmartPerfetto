# Backend Rules

## Runtime Selection

SmartPerfetto has five production agent runtimes behind the shared
`IOrchestrator` contract:

- `claude-agent-sdk`: default runtime for Claude Code, Anthropic direct,
  Bedrock, Vertex, and Anthropic-compatible providers.
- `openai-agents-sdk`: OpenAI Responses API and OpenAI-compatible Chat
  Completions providers.
- `pi-agent-core`: Pi Agent Core runtime, selected through custom Provider
  Manager profiles or explicit env/runtime pins.
- `opencode`: OpenCode SDK runtime, selected through custom Provider Manager
  profiles or explicit env/runtime pins.
- `qoder-agent-sdk`: opt-in Qoder Agent SDK runtime, selected through custom
  Provider Manager profiles or explicit env/runtime pins; local CLI auth is
  allowed only after the optional SDK is installed.

Runtime selection lives in `backend/src/agentRuntime/runtimeSelection.ts`.
Selection order is:

1. Explicit Provider Manager profile for the request.
2. Persisted session snapshot runtime/provider on recovery.
3. `SMARTPERFETTO_AGENT_RUNTIME` when no provider is pinned.
4. Default `claude-agent-sdk`.

Do not treat provider names such as DeepSeek or Qwen as runtime values. Valid
runtime values are `claude-agent-sdk`, `openai-agents-sdk`, `pi-agent-core`,
`opencode`, and `qoder-agent-sdk`.

## Primary Flow

Current backend analysis path:

```text
POST /api/agent/v1/analyze
  -> backend/src/routes/agentRoutes.ts
  -> AgentAnalyzeSessionService.prepareSession()
  -> createAgentOrchestrator()
  -> selected runtime: typed turn intent + authorized, on-demand tools
  -> shared MCP / Skill / trace_processor_shell + raw execution capture
  -> exact runtime result + private finalization context
  -> product-owned finalizeAnalysisResult()
  -> SSE projection + report generation + analysis-result snapshot
```

## AI Output Contract

Treat the final answer as a multi-surface contract, not one Markdown string:

```text
Runtime output
  -> exact AnalysisResult + private RuntimeFinalizationContext
  -> canonical body / original typed claims / captured evidence
  -> finite proof + at most one no-tool semantic review
  -> HTML report and CLI turn files
  -> analysis-result snapshot
  -> frontend SSE projection and visible chat conclusion
```

Keep these boundaries intact:

- Strategy frontmatter can declare `final_report_contract`; loaders and gates
  enforce required sections instead of relying only on prompt wording.
- Claims in the final result should be backed by Skill/SQL evidence, claim
  verification, or an explicit uncertainty marker.
- A parsed turn intent or claim declaration is model input, not truth or
  authorization. Preserve the original proposition and its references; do not
  rewrite a causal claim into a simpler numeric claim to obtain a passing check.
- The product owner takes the private context from the exact runtime result
  before copying or projecting it and invokes `finalizeAnalysisResult` once.
  Finalization keeps the pinned provider, original absolute deadline and live
  owner/authorization checks. Its semantic review has no tools and cannot
  restart acquisition, extend the deadline, or rewrite the answer to repair
  style. Missing evidence/review remains explicit.
- Finite proof reads issued, immutable execution captures whose original values
  were retained before display or transport truncation. Units and field semantics
  need producer authority;
  display strings, inferred column names, Query Review and restored snapshots
  cannot supply it. The supported predicate catalog is
  `SUPPORTED_DETERMINISTIC_CLAIM_RULES`; general causality is not a finite proof.
- Chat projection may hide low-signal appendix details, raw SQL, snapshot IDs,
  or audit metadata, but reports, snapshots, and CLI artifacts must keep the
  provenance needed for later review and comparison.
- Do not patch only one surface when changing final-result shape. Check SSE
  payloads, HTML reports, CLI persistence/export, session snapshots, and
  generated frontend contracts.
- Tool narration is a two-sided contract in `backend/src/agentv3/toolNarration.ts`:
  `formatToolCallNarration` says what a call is for, `formatToolResultNarration`
  says what came back. Narrate from the **externally projected** result object
  (`projectToolResultForExternalSurface`) at the point the runtime still holds
  it — the `result` field on `agent_response` is byte-truncated for transport
  and can end mid-JSON. Several MCP tools wrap their JSON in guidance prose
  (skill notes prefix, reasoning nudge, active-phase reminder), so a structured
  consumer must extract the embedded JSON rather than parse the whole string.
  A registered tool with no narration case prints `调用工具 <name>`; a coverage
  test in `src/agentv3/__tests__/toolResultNarration.test.ts` enforces the set.
- A timeline line earns its place only when it says something the tool dispatch
  line could not. Result narration reports an *outcome*, not a shape: a row or
  column count answers "how much came back" when the reader is asking "did that
  work out", so `execute_sql` and `fetch_artifact` speak only when the result is
  empty — the case that forces the model to change approach. Tools whose result
  restates their own dispatch (`invoke_skill`, `submit_plan`,
  `submit_hypothesis`, `list_skills`, …) emit nothing. The same rule trims the
  evidence line and the phase-transition line; full provenance stays in the
  report and the snapshot, which is where it is consulted.
- Native completion and output origin establish delivery state. Error words,
  XML/tool-call examples, answer length or missing headings cannot establish
  provider failure or authorize another report attempt. Unknown native status
  stays unknown; submitted plan/hypothesis obligations and bound report
  assessments are checked separately from evidence and prose semantics.
- Evidence counts must come from a monotone, run-scoped signal. The two
  tool-call logs are not one: they are plan-adherence records, capped and
  trimmed from the front, and `replayPrePlanToolCalls` drops pre-plan calls
  that match no phase and then clears the pre-plan log — so a run that executed
  one query before planning can end with both logs empty. Use
  `countDispatchedToolCalls`, which reads a counter incremented at dispatch and
  reset only by `resetPrePlanToolCallsForNewRun`.
- The detector is deliberately biased toward missing failures rather than
  inventing them. A provider that worked, then died, leaves evidence behind and
  will not be caught — the run wastes its retries as before. That is the
  acceptable direction: a false positive corrupts a legitimate analysis, a
  false negative only costs what today already costs.
- Guard the whole retry decision, not the predicate inside it. Every OpenAI
  route back into the provider needs the guard: the final-report continuation
  is a disjunction (`shouldRequest… || (canRequest… && qualityIssue)`) whose
  second term fires on its own, and the plan continuation is reached *before*
  the plan-complete branch — an unfinished plan is exactly what a dead provider
  leaves behind.
- `plan_phase_updated` is emitted from nine sites across five files. Build its
  payload with `planPhaseUpdatedContent(...)` so `origin` (`auto` vs `model`) is
  always present: the process view shows automatic transitions, which nothing
  else in the stream reports, and skips model-driven ones because the
  `update_plan_phase` dispatch line already narrates them. Never infer origin
  from the summary wording — those strings are localized. Its statuses are
  `in_progress`, `completed`, `pending`, and `skipped`; a two-case mapping
  renders an evidence rollback as progress.
- `SSE_EVENT_TYPES` in `types/dataContract.ts` is documentation, not
  enforcement. Events reach the wire whether or not they are listed, so an
  event with no frontend handler is silently discarded after being computed and
  transmitted — `plan_submitted`, `plan_phase_updated`, and `plan_revised` were
  in that state. When adding an event, wire a consumer or say why there is none.
- Result confidence comes from `estimateAnalysisConfidence` in
  `agentv3/analysisTermination.ts`, shared by every runtime. Four private
  copies once disagreed exactly where the number matters most — with no
  findings to average, Claude returned 0.30 while OpenAI returned 0.55 whenever
  the conclusion string was non-empty, so the same trace scored differently
  depending only on which runtime ran it. Confidence follows the findings' own
  confidences; never infer it from the presence of text.
- Structured facts must be read from a tool result **before**
  `summarizeExternalToolResult` truncates it. `planPhaseId` and `success` are
  appended after the result body, so they are the first casualties of the
  2000-char transport cap: a realistic 13.8 KB skill result loses both, which
  silently degrades plan phase attribution to semantic inference and leaves
  tool success unknown. Pass `resultFacts` from `readToolResultFacts(...)` at
  the runtime call site; `resultText` is a fallback, not a source of truth.
- Model text written before a plan is complete is reasoning, not the answer.
  The OpenAI runtime already classifies it that way (`shouldExposeOpenAiAnswerDelta`)
  but only accumulated it for conclusion recovery, so it never reached a user
  surface; it now also feeds `ReasoningThoughtBuffer` and is emitted as one
  `thought` at the next tool call. Whether any appears depends on the provider:
  DeepSeek and GLM emit no prose between tool calls, so a run can legitimately
  show none. Project it the same way as the Responses-API reasoning branch —
  this is a public SSE surface.
- A policy refusal is not a tool malfunction. Around thirty MCP handlers answer
  a disallowed call with `{success: false, action_required: '<what to do
  instead>'}`; `isPolicyRefusalResult` recognises them by that field, which no
  genuinely broken tool supplies. Keep them out of aggregate failure-rate
  monitoring: the circuit breaker's remedy is to tell the model to simplify its
  scope, and in a real run one budget refusal plus two plan-phase refusals were
  enough to trip its 60%-of-5 threshold — the system manufacturing evidence
  that the model was failing, then shrinking its room because of it. The
  same-tool watchdog still counts them, because retrying a refused call is a
  loop worth interrupting.
- `sqlUsesProcessNameFilter` decides both the raw-SQL identity warning and
  Skill identity admission, so it is an accuracy control, not a formatting
  nicety. Any change to it must be checked in both directions against real
  query shapes — it previously required whitespace before the operator, which
  let `p.name='com.foo'` scope a query to one process while reading as
  unscoped. Quick mode answers through model-written raw SQL, where that style
  is ordinary.

## MCP Tool Registration

`backend/src/agentv3/claudeMcpServer.ts` implements the tools, and
`backend/src/agentv3/mcpToolRegistry.ts` is the source of truth for registered
tool descriptors, exposure levels, and runtime allowlists. Do not duplicate a
fixed tool count in docs or code.

Tool visibility is request-shaped:

- Quick/full shares the same request authorization and evidence-effect rules.
  Lightweight mode may compact result/catalog projections, but does not define
  a separate permission set or remove optional planning and authorized source
  tools merely because the budget is quick.
- `existing_only` denies acquisition tools at the shared handler/registry
  boundary while preserving allowed metadata and retained-artifact reads.
- Code-aware tools require codebase permission.
- Comparison tools are registered only when a `referenceTraceId` exists.
- External/public contracts should be derived from the registry view, not from
  an old static tool list.

## Runtime Concurrency Invariants

- `runtimeExecutionGuard.ts` owns runtime/session single-active execution.
  Cancellation may signal cleanup immediately, but ownership is retained until
  the outer execution settles; a stale token must never publish newer session
  state.
- `TraceProcessorSqlWorker` remains a single worker per processor key. Do not
  introduce same-trace SQL parallelism. Different processor keys may progress
  independently.
- Runtime tools are exclusive by default. Only registry-declared commutative
  reads may use `runtimeToolConcurrency.ts`, and only after `task5` admission.
  Keep the fair reader/writer ordering, request scope, cancellation, bounded
  parallelism, and re-entrancy rejection intact.
- `SMARTPERFETTO_ADMITTED_RUNTIME_CANDIDATES` is a maintainer-only fail-closed
  boundary for `task4` through `task9`. It is not Provider Manager/UI/provider
  configuration. Do not infer it from credentials, benchmark artifacts, or
  persisted sessions, and do not auto-activate candidates.
- `SMARTPERFETTO_SAFE_TOOL_CONCURRENCY=false` is a rollback after `task5`
  admission. It must never bypass absent admission.
- Keep correctness and observability behavior outside the performance gates:
  processor/cache single-flight and failed-load retry, cancellation cleanup,
  runtime execution isolation, deterministic repairs, and internal receipts
  must work with no candidates admitted.

`RuntimePerformance` is internal RunManifest data. Record real phase spans,
first output, tool scheduling, and SQL queue/execution timing without exposing
raw SQL, processor identifiers, secrets, or unbounded provider content. Do not
add model, provider snapshot, usage, or performance fields to public SSE as an
incidental benchmark shortcut; any public contract expansion needs its own
privacy and compatibility review.

The candidate scopes are durable architecture boundaries: `task4` reuses quick
evidence; `task5` admits commutative reads; `task6` overlaps Claude/OpenAI
preflights; `task7` overlaps independent Pi startup and enables quick parallel
batch scheduling without bypassing descriptor/tool exclusivity; `task8`
uses OpenCode adaptive observation; and `task9` overlaps Qoder registry/SDK
startup. Shipped defaults remain serial until genuine five-adapter
deterministic admission and bounded real-provider A/B are available. Synthetic
scorer fixtures test scoring mechanics only.

## Self-Evolution Control Plane

- `backend/src/services/selfEvolution/` owns manifests, feedback isolation,
  evaluation corpus, proposal lifecycle, paired replay, overlay artifacts,
  generation publishing, reconciliation, contribution bundles, and rollback.
- `backend/src/routes/selfEvolutionAdminRoutes.ts` is the only HTTP control
  plane. Keep handlers thin and preserve separate
  `self_evolution:read|curate|export|apply|revert` permissions.
- Curation is explicit and public-feedback-only. Private feedback must never
  enter proposal evidence, contribution bundles, metrics detail, or an
  external judge.
- Online feedback statistics are hypothesis generation only. Apply eligibility
  requires the fixed validation + holdout baseline/candidate replay and human
  acceptance.
- `SELF_EVOLUTION_ENABLED` and `SELF_EVOLUTION_APPLY` default off. Apply/revert
  must fail closed unless effective apply is enabled and persistent user data
  outside the package is available.
- Keep operation streams scope-bound and bounded. Browser consumers require
  fetch-based SSE so Authorization and workspace headers remain attached.
- Contribution export creates a local deidentified artifact and never uploads,
  commits, opens a PR, or changes the TypeScript runtime.
- External L2 judge use requires a versioned rubric, sampled/disputed routing,
  and explicit per-use consent. Do not infer consent from Provider Manager or
  add an undocumented environment switch.

## Analysis Options Propagation

`agentRoutes.ts` passes options into `orchestrator.analyze(...)` through an
explicit whitelist. When adding a field to `AnalysisOptions`, update that
whitelist in the same change. Otherwise the HTTP body field is silently dropped
before it reaches a runtime. Private issued capabilities are internal options
sidecars, never fields accepted from request JSON.

Important whitelisted examples:

- `selectionContext`
- `analysisMode`
- `traceContext`
- `providerId`
- `referenceTraceId` / comparison context wiring

## Analysis Mode

`options.analysisMode` accepts `fast`, `full`, or `auto`.

- `fast` and `full` choose runtime budgets; neither selects a report, requires a
  plan, grants source access, or silently removes authorized capabilities.
- `auto` follows the shared typed intent's complexity recommendation. Every
  native engine uses its own pinned no-tool intent transport and the same
  registry validation. Unavailable classification uses the explicit fallback,
  not a keyword or deleted scene-classifier routing path.
- Scope, deliverable and evidence access are separate intent dimensions.
  `existing_only` strictly prohibits new evidence acquisition while allowing
  retained artifact reads. `read_new` still requires the request's existing
  authorization. Bounded or unavailable intent does not trigger automatic
  prefetch. Planning is on demand; an explicitly submitted plan remains binding.

Keep scoped selection questions lightweight. A selected slice/range is a scope
signal, not an automatic quick/full decision.

## Provider and Session Invariants

- New sessions pin the effective provider/runtime at creation time.
- Existing live sessions keep their pinned provider unless an explicit
  `providerId` override changes it.
- Persisted sessions restore the provider/runtime snapshot before continuing.
- `providerId: null` means use env/default fallback and ignore Provider Manager.
- If a persisted snapshot references a deleted provider, fail with an explicit
  provider-not-found error instead of silently falling back.
- Comparison sessions include both current and reference trace context; do not
  register comparison-only tools when no reference trace exists.
- Conversation keeps a product-owned, memory-only evidence context for the
  logical session and exact trace pair, authorization fingerprint and owner
  scope. Each physical runtime session/run stays unique. Issued bindings survive
  internal option spreads but cannot be recreated by JSON; a missing binding
  cannot fall back to a cached issued store facade.
- Release an evidence binding after finalization and clean up that physical
  session. Scope changes or product disposal revoke the evidence context. Old
  cancellation, callbacks and cleanup must not affect a successor. A bounded
  retained-artifact catalog supplies locators, not rows, coverage or proof.
- Historical report/snapshot reads project stored results without invoking a
  new finalizer or granting new evidence authority. Normal read authorization
  still applies; persisted captures cannot recreate private execution witnesses.

## TypeScript Conventions

- Use TypeScript strict mode and existing local patterns.
- Prefer structured parsing, typed contracts, and existing services over ad hoc
  string handling.
- Keep route handlers thin when behavior belongs in application/services.
- For generated or mirrored contracts, update the source generator/template and
  regenerate instead of hand-editing outputs.

## Build Errors in Unfamiliar Files

Before fixing a build error, check whether the file is generated. Look for:

- `Generated`
- `Auto-generated`
- `generated/`
- `dist/`
- copied frontend bundles

If generated, fix the generator or source contract, then regenerate.
