# Codebase-Aware Analysis Rules

Use these rules before touching code-aware analysis, codebase registry, source ingestion, symbol resolution, patch proposal, or code-aware report/UI surfaces.

## Product Boundary

- Treat source code as user-owned local material. Authorized owner-facing analysis may display and retain quoted source in local history, reports, exports, and result snapshots. Do not copy raw tool payloads into logs, telemetry, opaque provider transcripts, or public artifacts. Keep private knowledge filtering separate.
- Registration makes a codebase selectable; it never attaches source to an analysis automatically. Every run must carry an explicit selection.
- The Web Add and use action may combine registration, disclosed provider consent, and explicit current selection. Register-only leaves selection and consent unchanged; metadata-only selections are never silently upgraded.
- LLM-visible output should prefer `CodeRef` metadata: `referenceId` or `chunkId`, relative `filePath`, `lineRange`, `symbol`, `codebaseId`, `buildId`, `vendor`.
- Raw excerpt inspection endpoints remain RBAC-protected. Their transient frontend caches clear on session/trace switch, panel unmount, permission revoke, reindex, and delete; authorized quotations already saved in analysis results are user artifacts.
- `metadata_only` must never send source snippets to providers. `provider_send` still requires per-codebase `sendToProvider` consent.
- Trace/Skill/SQL supports occurrence in the current trace through its evidence contract. `CodeRef` locates source and supplies candidate mechanism context; it cannot prove implementation behavior or raise occurrence or root-cause confidence alone. Mechanism status is `corroborated`, `compatible`, `ambiguous`, or `unverified`.

- At source activation, disclose that relevant snippets go to the configured AI service, quotations can be saved with local results/exports, provider retention depends on its policy/configuration, and source search/read/model work increases analysis time. Never promise third-party zero retention.

## Backend

- Register and preview paths through `PathSecurityGate`; never trust a client-supplied root directly.
- A live registered root is sufficient for bounded `search_codebase` and `read_codebase_file`; an active index is optional acceleration, not an analysis prerequisite.
- Explicit source selection makes authorized tools available to the primary run. The AI decides whether source lookup is needed within the runtime evidence policy and caller budgets; completion does not require a lookup or `record_source_use_decision` call. An incomplete search cannot support a source-absence claim.
- On-demand access must enforce the registered path filters, extension/size limits, provider consent, bounded results/line ranges, secret redaction, and the private-output projection. Never return an absolute root.
- Code-aware chunks must carry `codebaseId` and `registryOrigin='codebase_registry'`.
- `app_source`, `kernel_source`, or registry-origin chunks missing codebase metadata must fail closed with `invalid_codebase_metadata`.
- Indexed lookup handlers must pass through `LookupResponseFilter`; on-demand handlers must pass through `OnDemandSourceAccessService` and the same external-surface projection boundary before results leave the runtime.
- SSE/snapshot/report/export paths use the owner-result projector; logs and public artifacts use the strict projector. Never pass raw MCP tool results directly to either audience. Keep audience scopes synchronous and exception-safe, and fix streaming audience at construction.
- Parse native conclusion declarations before display replacement. Keep original verification values in the private finalization context and bind them to the exact run, attempt and public candidate with an issued receipt. Never verify rewritten display values or recover validation authority from serialized output. Project protocol fields structurally and serialize text values safely; preserve invalid native declarations as invalid.
- `SourceUseDecisionV1` is actual current-run MCP state, not model-authored prose. It records selected/queried/used IDs, status, structured reason code, coverage, and safe references. `pending` and `attempted` are audit states and do not override native completion or make the answer partial by themselves. Unchecked source claims remain unverified; actual invalid bindings and private-output projection failures retain their separate verification and delivery consequences.
- Issue model-visible `sourceReferences` before delivering lookup results; admit them into the current-run ledger before exposing associated body or authorizing patches. At reference capacity, return an explicit bound instead of silently dropping issued references. Accept safe relative Unicode and spaced paths consistently across reading, source identity, reports, and verification.
- An explicit stop decision cannot hide subsequent actual source calls. A requested file window is not incomplete search coverage; preserve real search incompleteness while allowing bindings to positively identified source.
- `SourceClaimBindingV1` uses only references returned by the current selected partition; any Trace references must belong to the same claim. `corroborated` requires verified trace occurrence plus `provider_send` body/indexed evidence; `metadata_only` is locate-only. Pure `source.location` claims use the exact returned `semantics.source` tuple without requiring a duplicate root binding. If provided, that claim's binding must be unique, use the same source ID and contain no Trace IDs. Location proof covers only the current returned location snapshot and still requires complete semantic review of the displayed proposition.
- Initial/replayed SSE, HTML reports, CLI JSON/Markdown/HTML, analysis-result snapshots, and report/snapshot APIs share the canonical owner projector. Source quotations and real check diagnostics remain readable even when success is false; preserve verification/completion status. Strict source-echo capacity limits must not suppress owner output. The Web receipt remains metadata-only with no CodeRefs; do not expose registered absolute roots or credentials.
- Owner process views retain model-provided analysis commentary and shared tool/outcome narration; raw tool payloads remain outside chat. Strict private process projections may omit model events without repetitive placeholders. Receipt mechanism status comes from the actual source-claim verifier, never a model declaration. Index failure messages must distinguish capacity failure from fresh root access checks; source access scope affects both indexed and on-demand paths.
- Keep prompt content in `backend/strategies/` and Skills in `backend/skills/`; do not hardcode code-aware prompting in TypeScript.

## Patch Proposals

- `propose_patch` requires prior successful code lookup in `CodeLookupLedger`.
- On-demand `referenceId` records deliberately do not authorize `propose_patch`; patch targets remain tied to previously looked-up indexed `chunkId` context.
- Reject context from multiple codebases in Phase 1.
- Verify target files are inside previously looked-up context.
- Run `git apply --check` in the target codebase root before returning a `verified` patch.
- `sketch` and `unverified` responses must not expose copyable unified diff text.

## Verification

After backend changes:

```bash
cd backend
npm run typecheck
npm run validate:strategies
npm run validate:skills
npm run test:scene-trace-regression
```

After plugin UI changes:

```bash
./scripts/start-dev.sh
# Stop the dev server after browser verification.
(cd perfetto && tools/node ui/build.mjs)
./scripts/update-frontend.sh
```

Before landing:

```bash
npm run verify:pr
```

For full code-aware validation:

```bash
npm --prefix backend run verify:codebase-aware
npm --prefix backend run test:source-claim-contract
npm --prefix backend run test:report-contracts
npm --prefix backend run verify:code-aware-semantic-delta
```

This gate depends on local Heavy/Light traces plus a local
`HighPerformanceFriendsCircle` checkout. It verifies both no-codebase
trace-only behavior and configured-codebase reports/exports with source-level
`CodeRef` assertions.

`verify:code-aware-semantic-delta` is deterministic local evidence. It must
cover A0 no source, A1/A2 no-index access, A3 indexed access, A4 wrong-source
rejection, quantitative `not_needed`, source-binding strength, and the shared
runtime finalizer. Report real-provider acceptance separately; unavailable
credentials are `REAL PROVIDER NOT AVAILABLE`, not a pass.
